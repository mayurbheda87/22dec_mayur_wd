    <p>7) What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</p>
    <p><b>Ans:</b>Session state is saved on the server, ViewState is saved in the<br> page. Session state is usually cleared after a period of inactivity from <br>the user (no request happened containing the session id in the request <br>cookies). The view state is posted on subsequent post back in a hidden field.</p>
