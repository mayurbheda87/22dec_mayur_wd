    <p>1) What is JavaScript?</p>
    <p><b>Ans:</b>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you <br>to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more <br>than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — <br>displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D <br>graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is <br>probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web <br>technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more <br>detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
