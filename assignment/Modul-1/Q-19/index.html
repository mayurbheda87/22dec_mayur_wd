        <p class="para-1">(19) What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</p>
        <p><b>Ans:</b><br>HTML is SGML-based while XHTML is XML-based. They are like two sides of the same coin. <br>XHTML was derived from HTML to conform to XML standards. <br>Hence XHTML is strict when compared to <br>HTML and does not allow user to get away with lapses in coding and structure.
